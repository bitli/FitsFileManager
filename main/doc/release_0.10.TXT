I have significantly modified the FITS_key that copy files based on FITS keywords, it was written by of Nicolay (I hope he doesn't mind).
FITS File manager support generating a file path from the FITS keyword in a flexible way (using a pattern). The file path can include commonly used FITS keywords, parts of the original file name and a count which can be based on selected elements (typically the target directory, but could be the filter or other variables).

The script is attached. This scripts move and copy files, it is potentially dangerous, use at your own risk (however I use it on my machine).
It must scan the files and regenerate the output file names very often, so the UI may be a little slow if you have a lot of files on a slow machine. Avoid selecting all your 'c:' drive as a source . Prefer to use copy over move to be on the safe side until you are confident in the script.

Thanks to Niicolay for the original contribution. All bugs are mine. The documentation fullfill the PI standard  ;)
