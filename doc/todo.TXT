//FITSFileManager - todo.txt


GUI
   Make the 'text' button (for FITS keyword presentation) more visible, possibly on the right.
   May be allow to preview or open a selected file
   ++ select all, -- deselect all
   reset all, reset to defaults for each field

FITS keyword export
*   Check if CONTINUE keyword is supported
   Support long comments with blank as continuation
   Support export of FITS keywords as CSV or tab delimite
   Possibility to add FITS keywords to copied files (to replace erroneous values or add missing ones)
   Operations:
      Delete if present (support wild cards)
      Rename keyword
      Overwrite value (can use original one to normalize)
      Add if missing, keep if present
      Add comment
      Ensure present or fail
      Ensure not present or fail
   Possibility to check FITS header for suspect values and consistency (for example with size)
  (maybe implement as a special type of field on a configuration) 

File format support
   Load of zip files
   Support hints for loading/writing FITS files (possibly driven by configuration)
       Use a hint fields generated by template
   Support mirroring on keyword, conversion to rescaled float, subtraction of pedestal
   Maybe support for raw or tiff files
   Check # of images in file (when using load image), possibility ot extract specific one or all of them.
   Support 'ignore files' by criteria 

   
Configurations
   (maybe rename as ruleset)
   Make cleaning of the values of FITS keyword used in file name configurable, make warning if in action
   Support optional reformatting of file name as valid PI identifier
   Rework extraction of file part:
       A resolver for file parts (parth, name, extension) with configurable name cleaning (replacement of spaces and special characters)
       Preconfigured extractions (regexp) for header name part, remove numbers, remove filter, extract directory part, extract filter part,...
       Simple splitter as an alternate to regexp for file name
       Make file name extraction a part of configuration
   Add default value in configuration (would also ignore separator)
   Support simple list of values instead of list of regexp
   Option to collapse separators (--) if missing part (maybe part of file name cleaning)
   Alternate template depending on IMAGETYP or other keyword (maybe switch to alternate configuration for remaing keys)
   Detail log of actions for configuration
*   Enhance 'night' with accepting other dates and possibly midnight offset, use date formatter
   support for alternate source keywords for synthethic keywords, possibly default values in keyword mapping
   Make synthethic values from other synthetic values
   Option to select file by file name as BPP, generate keyword 
   Better error check and reporting for errors in configuring regexp or formats in configuration
   Safe format, check type
   Possibly generic FITS key with type depending on format, and alternate keys
   Make configuration files in order to be VCS friendly
   Keep track of last used directory
   Load configurations from script directory if emtpy on start

Depending on PJSR enhencements:
  Enhance control of ordering on GUI tables(support for ordering of non string values if possible)   

Operations
   Request confirmation for move (or move and copy)
   Support in place rename
   Batch mode (non GUI)
   Normalize directory (remove .., redundant /)
   Operation with overwrite of FITS header (no copy/move))
   Make creation of HISTORY/ORIGFILE keyword optional, make name of ORIGFILE key configurable

Results
   Create a log file to record the operations
